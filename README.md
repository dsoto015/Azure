# Microsoft Azure
In dealing with Windows server administration, it is important to understand how to use to use services like Microsoft Azure Active directory-or even the Active directory that comes with Windows-to monitor your servers. Azure however, is a cloud computing service created for building, testing, deploying, apps and services. Active directory is developed for domain networks and servers running Active directory are called Domain controllers and my project will be focused on using Azure Active directory-which i'm completely foreign to-to add users, give permissions, manage resource groups, and give them proper privileges based on a hypothetical company I will set up. 

# Dom Inc. 

10 users:

2 IT (1 sysadmin and 1 helpdesk)

3 Acct (Access to Sales files)

4 Sales (only access own group)

1 HR (access every group)

# Active Directory
It is important to secure the Operating System on any device and my project aims to display the severity
of a vulnerable machine and the capabilities a user with malicious intent. Once we properly secure the
OS we then must focus on implementing antivirus software to act as a barrier and screen traffic to and
from the host.

# Security 
1Things that will prevent or slow down gaining access to a machine from a hackers are:

-Automatic software patches

-Strong Firewall Policies

-Strong Password Policies

-Strong Audit Policies
