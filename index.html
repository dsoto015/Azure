    <h1> Microsoft Azure </h1>
    <p> In dealing with Windows server administration, it is important to understand how to use to use services like Microsoft Azure Active directory-or even the Active directory that comes with Windows-to monitor your servers. Azure however, is a cloud computing service created for building, testing, deploying, apps and services. Active directory is developed for domain networks and servers running Active directory are called Domain controllers and my project will be focused on using Azure Active directory-which i'm completely foreign to-to add users, give permissions, manage resource groups, and give them proper privileges based on a hypothetical company I will set up. </p>
